Title: Test Driven Development

I like [TDD](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/canon-tdd).\
I don't think it is a must, but I try to use it whenever possible and recommend it to others to try.\
I believe that TDD is a very useful tool as long as I write automated tests,
which I think are a must for any non-prototyping project.

Are there any benefits to writing tests first? Does it really matter?\
The point is in "driven". TDD is not "Test First Development".
* It makes me deeply consider testability from the beginning so that I don't need to change code later for testability.
* It helps me approach problems from **what** I am supposed to solve (requirements), rather than **how** (implementation details).
* Consequently, it lets me write testable code for clearer goals, which eventually increases productivity.

Once I can do these perfectly without TDD, I might not need TDD anymore. Until then, I'll keep using it.

As a bonus,
[transitioning from Red to Green](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/modern-c-programming/9781941222423/f_0054.html) gives me immediate feedback, especially when combined with continuous testing. It is very satisfying and addictive.
