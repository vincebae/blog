Here are my two (or three) primary principles on programming:
* [Low Coupling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-coupling-and-cohesion/), [High Cohesion](https://medium.com/clarityhub/low-coupling-high-cohesion-3610e35ac4a6)
* [Mind](https://blog.howareyou.work/what-is-cognitive-load-software-development/) [Cognitive Load](https://github.com/zakirullin/cognitive-load)

I found that most advices on programming can be explained by these principles.
