        <h1><a href="0004-java-optional-controversy.html">Java Optional Controversy</a></h1>
        <p>I have worked at a company and on a team where <code>Optional</code> is used extensively for a long time. So, I was very surprised when I found out that <code>Optional</code> is a <a href='https://nipafx.dev/inside-java-newscast-19/'>controversial topic</a>. There is even a camp that believes <a href='https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/optional-class-null-pointer-drawbacks'><code>Optional</code> should be avoided</a>. Brian Goetz, the Java Architect, explicitly advocates the <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26327957/should-java-8-getters-return-optional-type/26328555#26328555'>"Use Optional as a Return Value in Limited Cases" camp</a> on Stack Overflow. This Stack Overflow post was written in 2014, and comments are still active even in 2024.</p><p>All this controversy confused me a lot. My current team follows Brian Goetz's opinion, and it is not very easy to persuade them to use <code>Optional</code> more broadly whenever needed.</p><p>Then, I found this comment in Brian Goetz's post, and my mind became clear:<blockquote><p> Java did not invent Optional. Neither does Java's Optional type do anything special than its usage in other languages.  </p></blockquote>Yes, <code>Optional</code> (or <code>Option</code> or <code>Maybe</code>) probably predates Java. Java users used custom <code>Optional</code> types (e.g., Guava) even before <code>java.util.Optional</code> was added. The opinion of the <i>Java Architect</i> doesn't need to be considered the golden rule in this case. Actually, there are other opinions even within the Java core team as mentioned <a href='https://nipafx.dev/inside-java-newscast-19/'>here</a>.</p><p>I know that Java <code>Optional</code> has issues. It has memory overhead. It can make code look uglier. It is sometimes not very ergonomic to use. It is not very well integrated with older Java libraries.</p><p>However, it is still Java's best weapon against <code>NullPointerException</code>.</p>

        <h1><a href="0003-test-driven-development.html">Test Driven Development</a></h1>
        <p>I like <a href='https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/canon-tdd'>TDD</a>. I don't think it is a must, but I try to use it whenever possible and recommend it to others to try. I believe that TDD is a very useful tool as long as I write automated tests, which I think are a must for any non-prototyping project.</p><p>Are there any benefits to writing tests first? Does it really matter? The point is in "driven". TDD is not "Test First Development".</p><ul><li>It makes me deeply consider testability from the beginning so that I don't need to change code later for testability.</li><li>It helps me approach problems from <strong>what</strong> I am supposed to solve (requirements), rather than <strong>how</strong> (implementation details).</li><li>Consequently, it lets me write testable code for clearer goals, which eventually increases productivity.</li></ul><p>Once I can do these perfectly without TDD, I might not need TDD anymore. Until then, I'll keep using it.</p><p>As a bonus, <a href='https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/modern-c-programming/9781941222423/f_0054.html'>transitioning from Red to Green</a> gives me immediate feedback, especially when combined with continuous testing. It is very satisfying and addictive.</p>

        <p>Here are my two (or three) fundemental principles on programming:</p><ul><li><a href='https://itnext.io/complexity-coupling-and-cohesion-a74db76c968d'>Low</a> <a href='https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-coupling-and-cohesion/'>Coupling</a>, <a href='https://medium.com/clarityhub/low-coupling-high-cohesion-3610e35ac4a6'>High Cohesion</a></li><li><a href='https://blog.howareyou.work/what-is-cognitive-load-software-development/'>Mind</a> <a href='https://github.com/zakirullin/cognitive-load'>Cognitive Load</a></li></ul><p>I found that most advice on programming falls into these principles.</p>
